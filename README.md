# Moldule-02-Challenge

My Portfolio

## Description

This project is a Responsive Website to be used as my Portfolio during this course. Our goal was to make it responsive and use some styles that we learned on the past week. I had some trouble with making the website responsive, but it was solved when I watched some videos and I created a tecnic of adding background color to the tags so I could locate better myself on what I was moving and changing in the css. 

## Usage

This Website is really easy to use, it is just a web page with some of my projects from the Bootcamp. I already added the first Challenge that we had to do last week, and more are coming to add to the website.
